Yeah, I keep dreaming
That I have it all
I'm always waiting
For that something more

I'm still craving
To have you by my side
I know our love is fading
But soon it will shine

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head
And in my brain it's going wrong

And I will live today
And I will live tomorrow
No matter what is said or done

Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
You're burning out my head

I keep searching
Forever in your eyes
I'll be careful
But soon we will shine

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head
And in my brain it's going wrong

And I will live today
And I will live tomorrow
No matter what is said or done

Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
You're burning out my head

Even if it's going wrong
You're burning out my head

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head

And in my brain it's going wrong
And I will live today
And I will live tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if it's going wrong
